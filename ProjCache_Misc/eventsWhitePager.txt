General separator rules:
L1 separator logically is "and"
L2 separator logically is "or"

1.
eventID
Integer
Must unique
eventID will be automatically generate by Events class when add the event
eventsID is the nth event in events.csv and eventList in Events class, start from 0

2.
eventName
String
This is the first parameter in Event constructor
All events in events.csv and eventList will be sorted by eventName

3.
createDate
The date that the event create
Use YYYY-MM-DD format.
E.g. “2019-6-1”

4.
createTime
The time that the event create
Use HH:MM format.
E.g. “16:48”

5.
priorityLevel
Integer
Bigger is higher priority level
Normally event priorityLevel is 0
The priorityLevel of the default event is -1

6. Temporary abandon, write "NULL" here
triggerableDay
String
Use the first 3 characters of day name indicate the day.
Use "|" without space to separate days.
Be careful!! Use "\\|" when parse due to Java's syntax.
All days should follow the order of Monday to Sunday.
E.g. "MON|TUE|FRI|SAT"
Use "WKD" for weekdays that is Monday to Friday.
Use "WKN" for weekend that is Saturday and Sunday.
If triggerableDay is "NULL", it means it will available all the day.

7. Temporary abandon, write "NULL" here
triggerableTime
String
HH:MM-HH:MM###HH:MM-HH:MM
Use "|" without space to separate days.
Be careful!! Use "\\|" when parse due to Java's syntax.
E.g. “16:59-17:50|18:20-22:25”
Time should not have superposition.
The constructor will automatically convert it to no superposition.
E.g. If input is "14:00-16:00|15:00-17:00|20:00-21:00",
     then the constructor will automatically convert it to
     "14:00-17:00|0:00-21:00"

8 & 9
triggerMethod & triggerValues
String
Use “|” without space as L1 separator to separate each triggerMethod
The first position triggerValues match the first position triggerMethod
E.g. triggerMethod            triggerValues
     “TIME|BLUETOOTH”         "20:00-22:30#23:00-23:30|WH-1000Xm3"
Explanation: Trigger this event if:
                1. time is in 20:00-22:30 or in 23:00-23:30
                2. Bluetooth connected to WH-1000Xm3
The explanation of keywords will be in MethodValue&TaskValue Documentation.

10 & 11
tasksTypeStart & taskValueStart
String
Use “|” without space as L1 separator to separate each taskTypeStart
The first position tasksTypeStart match the first position taskValueStart
E.g. tasksTypeStart             taskValueStart
     OPEN_APP|VOLUME|MODE       tv.danmuku.bili|50|DO_NOT_DISTRIBUTE
Explanation: When the event triggered, then do:
                1. Open Bilibili app
                2. Change volume to 50%
                3. Change mode to "Do not distribute"
The explanation of keywords will be in MethodValue&TaskValue Documentation.

12 & 13
tasksTypeEnd & tasksValueEnd
String
All same with 10 & 11
The only different is when the event ends, do tasksTypeEnd & tasksValueEnd

14 & 15
tasksTypeOngoing & tasksValueOngoing
constructingAll same with 10 & 11
The only different is these is triggered during the event running


16.
tasksOngoingRepeatPeriod
String
E.g.
tasksTypeOngoing            PHONE_CALL|SMS_MESSAGE
tasksValueOngoing           1234567890|1234567890::"Hello World~""
tasksOngoingRepeatPeriod    5000|200
This means that call the number 1234567890 every 5000 minutes, and send "Hello
World~" by sms message to the number 1234567890 every 200 seconds.
Careful!: m and s cannot

17.
instantEvent
Boolean
If true, there are only start tasks when the event triggered, after the tasks
finished, the event finished. 

18.
oneTimeEvent
Boolean
If true, this event will automatically set the isActivated value to false

19.
autoTrigger
Boolean
If true, this event can be triggered automatically without click the event core card.
If false, this event can be triggered only when the user click the event core card.

20.
isActivated
Boolean
If true, this event is activated, and it can be triggered.
If false, this event is not activated, it cannot be triggered.

21.
eventImage
String
Store the requirement information to create the Drawable object for the image

22.
eventColor
Integer
Hexadecimal integer to store the RGB value of the color

23.
eventCategory
String
The category of the event, used for classify events.

24.
executedTimes
Integer
How many times did this event executed.
